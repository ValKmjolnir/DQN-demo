# DQN-demo

## Description

Simple DQN demo using nasal programming language.

DQN data will be stored in file: agent.dat

Use this command to train the model:

> ./nasal dqn.nas

And use this command to test the model:

> ./nasal test.nas

Also, `system("cls")` in `map.nas` is used in windows powershell. Delete it or changing it to `system("clear")` if using Linux or MacOSX.

## What is Nasal?

[Nasal](http://wiki.flightgear.org/Nasal_scripting_language) is a programming language used in famous flight simulator [FlightGear](https://www.flightgear.org/).It's quite simple and easy to learn and use.

I wrote an stack-based bytecode interpreter that can run this language out of flightgear environment efficiently.
